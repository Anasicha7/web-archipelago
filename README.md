# Coffee Archipelago - Web Development Portfolio

## ☕ About the Project
This project is a website designed for an Indonesian coffee supplier, "Coffee Archipelago." It showcases various types of coffee beans (Arabica and Robusta), their unique processing methods, and their regions of origin across Indonesia. 

I developed this project to demonstrate my skills in frontend development as part of my application for the **Ausbildung (Vocational Training) as a Fachinformatiker** in Germany.
